= mdsl - Ruby Multidimensional Scaling Library
This package contains the module MDS, a library for multidimensional scaling. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a set of related statistical techniques often used in information visualization for exploring similarities or dissimilarities in data.

Classical MDS is the only variant of MDS currently offered by mdsl.

= Simple Example
The sample below is actually a test. Given coordinates of three elements in two-dimensional space, calculate the squared Euclidean inter-distance matrix between the elements. Then, use MDS to yield coordinates again in a space that captures 99% of the variances of all distances. Finally, assert that the resulting coordinates preserve the original distances.

  require 'mds'
  
  x = Matrix.rows([
    [1.0, 2.0], 
    [4.0, 3.0],
    [0.0, 1.0]
  ])
    
  d = Matrix.l2_distances_squared(x)
  c = MDS::Classical.new(d)
  proj = c.project(d, c.min_dims(0.99))
  d_proj = Matrix.l2_distances_squared(proj)
  
  assert(Matrix.equal_in_delta?(d, d_proj))
